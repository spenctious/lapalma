          <div class="content-box">
            <p>
              La Palma is one of the western-most of the Spanish Canary Islands, part
              of Macronesia which includes the Azores and Madeira to the north
              and Cape Verde to the south. The nearest land south Morocco
              about 445km away. Direct flights take about four and a half
              hours.

          <div class="content-box">
            <p>
              Not for nothing is La Palma is known as &lsquo;La Isla
              Bonita&rsquo; - the beautiful island. The greenest of the Canary
              Islands is only half the size of it's better known neighbour
              Tenerife but it has everything a nature-loving walker could ask
              for without any of the mass-tourism that the bigger islands
              have. La palma can boast:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                A thousand kilometers of supported and maintained waymarked
                trails
              </li>
              <li>One of the world's largest erosion craters</li>
              <li>
                The last remnants of ancient laurel forest dating from the
                tertiary period
              </li>
              <li>A unique string of volcanos along its spine</li>
              <li>
                Dramatic deep-cut ravines with their own microclimates and
                vegetation
              </li>
              <li>
                Miles of pristine coastline with surprising beachside
                communities
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <h2>What's it like?</h2>
          <div class="content-box">
            <p>
              The island is dominated by the Caldera and the Cumbre Vieja which rise up in the middle of the island and seperate the two main towns of Santa Cruz and Los Llanos. Most settlements are small villages dotted around the coast interspersed with isolated farms and cottages. It's a quiet and relaxing sort of place though the locals still appreciate a good festival now and then.
            </p>
            <p>
              The various altitudes and the prevailing moisture-laden winds from the north-east mean that there are at least seven distinct vegetation zones ranging from coastal to summit scrub. Laurel forest (laurisilva), thermophylic forest with dragon trees, spectacular spurge and euphorbia and the local exuberent gardens complement the usual pine forest on the volcano slopes to create a highly varied landscape.
            </p>
            <p>
              Practically speaking La Palma is an easy island to explore due to its compact size and good transport. With a couple of larger excursions to explore the classic hikes it's possible to just base yourself in one location and experience a satisfying range of varied hikes without lots of travelling leaving you more time to soak in the chilled atmosphere.

          <h2>How do I get there?</h2>
          <div class="content-box">
            <p>
              There are some direct flights from the UK (TUI and EasyJet). Alternatively you can fly to Tenerife and take one of the regular ferries. Binter Air is the local carrier which can get you between the islands and there is a good direct bus service between Tenerife North (where flights from the UK usually land) and Tenerife South (where Binter flights usually land).
