            <div class="content-box">
              <p>
                The routes avail from this site are designed to be used with
                dedicated outdoor routing apps that use offline maps, they are
                not for use with more common mapping apps like Google Maps as
                these need a phone signal to work. There are many apps available
                and many of them are free (at least in the basic version).
              </p>
              <p>
                Many apps will try to push you to buy their maps but Open
                Streetmap maps are free and work perfectly well with these
                routes. Many apps will give you a choice of free maps based on
                Open Streetmap data.

              <h2>Getting started</h2>
            <div class="content-box">
              <p>
                App popularity changes all the time so start by checking out
                recent reviews and perhaps download a few apps to see which ones
                you get on with. Most apps make money from map sales or premium
                subscriptions so check there decent free maps available.
                Download one of the routes from this site and check you can get
                the app to see it and you can get the maps needed for the walk
                without too much difficulty.
              </p>
              <p>
                The author's favorite app is <strong>OsmAnd</strong> which
                started as an Android app but is available for iOS too now. Its
                maps are very compact so you can download the whole of the
                canary Islands in one go. You can also change the map appearance
                to your liking and get it to highlight all the waymarked trails.
              </p>
              <p>
                Whichever app you go for you are likely to have to spend some
                time working out how to get the maps and get a downloaded route
                into the app. It's an initial barrier to get over so try to
                figure it out before you leave home.

            <div class="content-box">
              <p>
                Nearly all apps use the standard GPX format but there are
                exceptions. For viewing a route on Google Earth (useful for
                satellite views of climbs) the KLM format is used. A few other
                apps such as Maps.me also support this format.
              </p>
              <p>
                To view routes in Google Earth just start the app (desktop
                version) and drag a downloaded route into the app.

              <h2>Limitations and cautions</h2>
            <div class="content-box">
              <p>
                GPS apps make trail navigation easy but its not foolproof. To be
                safe take note of the following points:
              </p>
              <ul class="bullets">
                <li>
                  <strong
                    >Always carry a paper map and compass with you as
                    backup</strong
                  >
                  and be sufficiently aware of where you are that you could
                  navigate with them if you had to.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong
                    >Fully charge your phone before you leave for the
                    trail</strong
                  >
                  and if you're not sure the battery will last the day take a
                  portable charger with you. If you're using your phone as your
                  camera then you should certainly take one on longer walks.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Don't assume GPS is pinpoint accurate.</strong>
                  If you're not sure about which path to take, choose the most
                  likely and head a short way down it before checking again. It
                  should then be clear if you've chosen the right way or not.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Expect to loose the signal sometimes.</strong>
                  A GPS device will loose the signal when it doesn't have a
                  clear view of the sky such as when you are in a deep barranco.
                  If your phone looses the signal when it shouldn't, try turning
                  location finding off and on again (in your phone's settings).
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Don't follow GPS blindly</strong>
                  If the path is clearly becoming dangerous, reconsider your
                  route. Don't forget that paths are sometimes rerouted for
                  safety and the GPS route might not be completely upto- date.
                </li>
