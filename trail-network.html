          <h1>Waymarked trails</h1>
          <p></p>
          <h2>The official trail network</h2>
          <p>
            The network of waymarked trails is organized into three main
            categories designated GR, PR or SL according to length and are
            numbered in a roughly anticlockwise order starting from Santa Cruz.
            The signing and route marking conforms to the European Ramblers'
            Association (ERA) guidelines so should be readily familiar to anyone
            who has walked such trails elsewhere in Europe.
          </p>
          <p>
            Trails are marked with two-colour blazes sited on walls, rocks, and
            sometimes the ground (but not on trees in areas prone to fire)
            according to their designation:
          </p>

          <div class = "bullet-style">
              <div class = "trail-marker"><div class="blaze"></div><div class="blaze gr"></div></div>
              <div class="bullet-style-text">GR (Gran Recorrido - Grand Tour). These are trails over 50 km
              intended as multi- day hikes. There are two of these on the
              island, the GR 130 coastal route and the GR 131 which takes a high
              line along the crater rim and down the island's spine. The two
              meet at Mirador el Time near Puerto de Tazacorte and Fuencaliente
              in the south.</div>
              
              <div class = "trail-marker"><div class="blaze"></div><div class="blaze pr"></div></div>
              <div class="bullet-style-text">PR (Senderos Peque√±o Recorrido - Short Trails). These are trails
              that can supposedly all be completed within a day, though you'd
              have to be pretty fit to complete some of them in that time. The
              majority of the island's trails have a PR designation.</div>
              
              <div class = "trail-marker"><div class="blaze"></div><div class="blaze sl"></div></div>
              <div class="bullet-style-text">SL (Senderos Locales - Local Trails). These are shorter linking
              paths that can be used as shortcuts, alternative routes and minor
              excursions. SL paths have recently been renamed with the middle
              letters changed to reflect the locality of the walk. There may be
              old signs or other references that have not been updated so ignore
              the middle letters and just go by the numbers which have not
              changed.</div>
              
          </div>
          <h2>Trail closures</h2>
          <p>
            If a trail is closed for any reason a sign will be put in place at
            the trail end points. This is a dispiriting thing to come across
            when you turn up for a walk so to avoid this situation check the
            trail status before you set out. Try to find out the cause and
            extend of a trail closure before abandoning a walk as sometimes only
            part of a path is closed for maintenance and your walk may not be
            affected. The closure signs on the trail never give any information
            but the website usually has some indication why the route is closed
            (though never really enough).
          </p>

          <h2>Other waymarked trails</h2>
          <p>
            In addition to the formal network there are a few other waymarked
            trails on the island which use a simpler, older style of signage but
            stick to the two-colour style of blazes along the trail.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is nearly always a marker somewhere near a junction so if you
            head off and don't see one fairly soon you may have gone the wrong
            way. If in doubt you can retrace your steps as it is sometimes
            easier to spot the marker when coming from the reverse direction.
          </p>

          <h1>Unmarked trails</h1>
          <p>
            There are many other unsigned paths on the island many of which are
            worth exploring. These paths can be usefully linked in with the
            trail network to form convenient circuits, connect featured walks
            and make shortcuts. Forestry paths are broad, easy to follow, and
            maintained by the forestry department, other paths will vary
            enormously and may be hard to follow and rather overgrown if not
            frequented by locals. GPS will help a lot in navigating these paths.
