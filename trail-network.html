          <div class="content-box">
            <p>
              The network of waymarked trails is organized into three main
              categories designated GR, PR or SL according to length and are
              numbered in a roughly anticlockwise order starting from Santa
              Cruz. The signing and route marking conforms to the European
              Ramblers' Association (ERA) guidelines so should be readily
              familiar to anyone who has walked such trails elsewhere in
              Europe.
            </p>
            <p>
              Trails are marked with two-colour blazes sited on walls, rocks,
              and sometimes the ground (but not on trees in areas prone to
              fire) according to their designation:

                two of these on the island, the GR 130 coastal route and the
                GR 131 which takes a high line along the crater rim and down
                the island's spine. The two meet at Mirador el Time near
                Puerto de Tazacorte and Fuencaliente in the south.

                within a day, though you'd have to be pretty fit to complete
                some of them in that time. The majority of the island's trails
                have a PR designation.

                have recently been renamed with the middle letters changed to
                reflect the locality of the walk. There may be old signs or
                other references that have not been updated so ignore the
                middle letters and just go by the numbers which have not
                changed.

          <div class="content-box">
            <p>
              If a trail is closed for any reason a sign will be put in place
              at the trail end points. This is a dispiriting thing to come
              across when you turn up for a walk so to avoid this situation
              check the trail status before you set out. Try to find out the
              cause and extend of a trail closure before abandoning a walk as
              sometimes only part of a path is closed for maintenance and your
              walk may not be affected. The closure signs on the trail never
              give any information but the website usually has some indication
              why the route is closed (though never really enough).

          <div class="content-box">
            <p>
              In addition to the formal network there are a few other
              waymarked trails on the island which use a simpler, older style
              of signage but stick to the two-colour style of blazes along the
              trail.
            </p>
            <p>
              There is nearly always a marker somewhere near a junction so if
              you head off and don't see one fairly soon you may have gone the
              wrong way. If in doubt you can retrace your steps as it is
              sometimes easier to spot the marker when coming from the reverse
              direction.

              There are many other unsigned paths on the island many of which
              are worth exploring. These paths can be usefully linked in with
              the trail network to form convenient circuits, connect featured
              walks and make shortcuts. Forestry paths are broad, easy to
              follow, and maintained by the forestry department, other paths
              will vary enormously and may be hard to follow and rather
              overgrown if not frequented by locals. GPS will help a lot in
              navigating these paths.
