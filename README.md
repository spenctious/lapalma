A walking guide to the Canary Island of La Palma

## Database integration
A database has been created from the original JSON files. The original data files are replaced by a single data file generated from a manually run PowerShell script running a stored procedure in the database.

## Other changes
The data is now refreshed from the server on a daily basis rather than being controlled by a version number.

## User changes
The user should see no change other than on the Browse Places screen where the places are now sorted aplhabetically by name.
